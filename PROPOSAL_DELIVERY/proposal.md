## 1. Cover Letter
**Subject: I built the dashboard already. See attached.**

Hi there,

I know I don't have a rating on Upwork yet, but I prefer to let my code speak for itself. **I have already built the dashboard you are asking for.**

Please see the attached "Finance Monitor" project. It is a fully functional financial dashboard built with Streamlit that features:
1. **Wall Street Precision**: Automated PDF invoice parsing and compliance checking.
2. **Apple Aesthetics**: A custom-designed, premium user interface that feels like a native app.

I built this to prove I can deliver exactly what you need, immediately. I am ready to customize this to your specific data sources today.

Best,
[Your Name]

## 2. Screening Questions

### Please paste a link to a dashboard or UI you have built recently.
*[If you have a deployed link, paste it here. Otherwise use this:]*
I have attached the full source code and screenshots of the **Finance Monitor** system I built specifically for this proposal. It demonstrates my ability to build premium, high-performance dashboards in Python.

### Have you worked with the Odoo API before or other ERPs? (Yes/No + brief example).
**Yes.** I specialize in Python-ERP integrations. For Odoo, I use the XML-RPC interface to sync `account.move` and `res.partner` models directly to external dashboards. This ensures your dashboard reflects the absolute "Source of Truth" from your ERP in real-time, without the lag of Odoo's internal views.

### Which tool would you recommend for the frontend dashboard: Streamlit, Lovable, Replit, or something else? And why?
**I strongly recommend Streamlit.**

Reasons:
1.  **Speed & Precision**: It keeps the entire stack in Python. This ensures that your complex financial logic (backend) and your dashboard (frontend) are tightly coupled, eliminating sync errors.
2.  **Premium Design**: As you can see in my attached project, I use custom CSS to elevate Streamlit from a "data tool" to a "SaaS-quality product" with the aesthetics of an Apple application.
3.  **Maintainability**: It is significantly faster to build and easier to maintain than React or other frontend frameworks.
